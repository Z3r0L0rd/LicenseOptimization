**License Optimization** is a program created using Python and built on the AWS Cloud platform. License Optimization provides the ability to manage and track license quantities to optimize license costs, minimize compliance risks, and increase software resource utilization efficiency.

**Project Objectives:**
- High license costs: Reduce license spending by 20-40%.
- Real-time analysis: Dashboard to monitor license usage.
- Compliance monitoring: Ensure compliance with license regulations.

**Main Features** of the Project:

- CRUD operations for license information.
- Data tables to observe license information.
- Usage trend analysis over time.
- Measure usage efficiency and allow exporting information for auditing.
- Simple ML integration for analysis, suggestions, and predicting license usage needs for users.
- Risk reporting for license expiration warnings and detecting license compliance violations.
- Support for exporting and importing license files for backup (JSON, CSV, Excel), support for cloud storage through DynamoDB and S3.
- Store and display logs for troubleshooting and system maintenance.

With these advantages, License Optimization can significantly reduce license distribution and auditing work to save time and costs for maintaining license operations.
