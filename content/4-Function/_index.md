The app page will display entered licenses in the form of charts and columns to help users view their license usage status. The app also supports importing and exporting information, storing user-entered information to send to the Cloud in case of emergencies, along with analysis and usage trend prediction functions to help users easily understand their license status and know the optimal choices in managing their license quantities most economically.

- If you don't really want to waste time creating sample data, you can access [sample data](https://github.com/Z3r0L0rd/license_optimize/blob/master/sample_licenses.csv) to download and import in the **Data Management** section by dropping the file you downloaded and clicking the **Import** button.
